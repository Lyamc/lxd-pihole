# lxd-pihole
Script for getting a pihole set up with lxd on Ubuntu

THIS IS INTENDED FOR A FRESH UBUNTU INSTALL, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO CHECKS FOR EXISTING LXD INSTALL OR CONTAINER NAMES

I haven't thoroughly tested this yet.


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lyamc/lxd-pihole/main/lxd-pihole.sh; chmod +x lxd-pihole.sh; ./lxd-pihole.sh
```
